# C Length Converter

This project is one of the first console applications I wrote while learning the C programming language.

The program takes a length value in centimeters (cm) from the user and converts it to meters (m) and kilometers (km), then prints the results to the console.

## Features
- Console-based C application
- Converts centimeters to meters and kilometers
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Uses basic C programming concepts

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard C Library (`stdio.h`)
